Unsupervised Learning for Clustering Car and Truck Images

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a project applying unsupervised learning techniques, particularly clustering, on a Kaggle dataset containing images of cars and trucks. The primary goal is to explore and implement clustering algorithms to group similar images without using labeled examples. This project serves as the author's first venture into unsupervised learning, with a focus on clustering as an introductory task.
